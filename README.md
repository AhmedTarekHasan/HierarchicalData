<p>
Sometimes you find yourself in a need to deal with Hierarchical Tree Form data. In simple words, this is data presented into parent-child nodes.
</p>

<p>
In such situations, you might sometimes struggle with the complexity of the implementation especially when dealing with a huge amount of data.
</p>

<p>
In this article, I would provide you with one of the possible designs for such cases. However, you need to keep in mind that, as usual, having a generic design could provide abstracted capabilities but it might lack specific enhancements for specific scenarios.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, I recommend that you deal with the design you would find in this article as a mind opener. You would need to study it, learn from it, get some ideas from it, and finally adapt it to your own needs.
